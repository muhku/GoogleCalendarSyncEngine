  http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/changelog.html

- Release builds on iPhone now compile out the elaborate descriptions
  for each GDataObject.  Developers can set GDATA_SIMPLE_DESCRIPTIONS
  in their projects to control this behavior.

  Developers can set STRIP_GDATA_FETCH_LOGGING in their projects to control
  this behavior.

- The GDataXMLNode xml shim now registers the topmost namespaces for XPath
  resolution.

- To reduce memory usage, GDataObject extensions are stored in arrays only
  when there is more than one instance of an extension class.

  server-generated NSErrors so that logged errors are more useful.
